LIKE I SAID.. I WARNED THEM EARLIER... 

HEY I'LL GIVE IT TO THEM... THEY 100% LIVE UP TO THE NAME... COMBINED ALSO.

ALL I ASKED FOR, INITIALLY WAS TO IMMEDIATELY BAR THEM - GENERALLY, FROM ACTING IN THEIR "CAPACITY"

--- I USE THAT TERM, VERY SPECIFICALLY AS WELL... COMBINED, CAN NOT COVER THE LOSSES NOW EITHER.

    --- NOT EVEN CLOSE, AND NO DOUBT ABOUT IT... THEY DID NOT SEE OR UNDERSTAND ANY OF THE INFORMATION ANNEXED...

    >> NOT EVEN THE VIOLATION OF PRIVACY SUIT AND WHAT IT BRINGS FORTH, BELIEVE ME.


OR DID YOU FORGET HOW TO READ AND SEND LETTERS ALL OF A SUDDEN.
--- NOW THINK ABOUT THAT WHILE I DEAL WITH THE REGULATORS.
I.    THEY MONITORED MY LAPTOP FROM OUTSIDE OF MY APARTMENT.
    - ON A 24 HOUR BASIS, RECORDED MY EVERY STEP AND MOTION.
